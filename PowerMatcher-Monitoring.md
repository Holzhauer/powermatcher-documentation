# PowerMatcher Monitoring 

There are several ways to monitor a PowerMatcher cluster. This section describes the logging framework within PowerMatcher. The logging framework supports several adapters for different log formats and monitoring options. The CSVLogger adaptor is the first implementation. A small tutorial is added that describes how to implement the KLE stack on top of the CSVLogger.
